#9 Homework for Lesson 9 for Friday 9 Feb 2024 by Daniel Clapa

Lesson 9 Homework, #1 and #2 above in TestRail, at least 2 functional and 2 non-functional test cases:

[HW 9] JPetStore Web App
https://beetrootqa2024.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/73&group_by=cases:section_id&group_order=asc&display_deleted_cases=0

#3 - 2 bugs in Jira: 
[SCRUM-55] [HW 9 JPetStore] Attempting to recreate an existing account gets no descriptive error message - Jira (atlassian.net) 

[SCRUM-59] After a product is found in Search add it to cart in one step - Jira (atlassian.net) 


Task 2 from LMS:

2. The following statement is about decision coverage:

When the code has a single 'IF' condition and no loops (LOOP) or switches
(CASE), any test we run will result in 50% decision coverage.

Which option is true about this statement?
a. Correct. Any test case provides 100% coverage of statements, thus
covering 50% of solutions.
b. Correct. The result of any IF condition test will be either true or false.
c. Incorrect. A single test case can guarantee 25% coverage of the solutions
in this case.
d. Incorrect, because it is too general a statement. We cannot know if it is
correct as it depends on the software being tested.

3. There’s the following pseudocode: Switch PC on -> Start MS Word -> IF MS Word
starts THEN -> Write a poem -> Close MS Word.

How many test cases will it take to test its functionality?
a. 1 for operator coverage, 2 for decision coverage
b. 1 for operator coverage, 1 for decision coverage
c. 2 for operator coverage, 2 for decision coverage
d. 2 for operator coverage, 1 for decision coverage

4. How many tests are needed to check code statements:


a. 2
b. 1
c. 3
d. 4



Task 3 from LMS:

We continue working on a startup for a cat photo sharing app.

There’s the following algorithm:

Ask what kind of pet the user has. [Q1]

If the user answers that they have a cat, 
then ask what breed it is: "short-haired or long-haired?" [Q2]

If the user answers "long-haired", 
then ask: "Would you like to get the contacts of the nearest groomer?" [Q3]

If the user answers "yes", 
then say: "Give me the address of the nearest cat grooming salon."
else
Say: "Suggest a shop with fur care products"
end
else
Say "Suggest a pet shop"
end

If the user has no cat
Say "Come back when you decide to get a cat"
end

Assignment:

1. Draw an algorithm diagram (in a tool of your choice, for example, in the built-in
Google Docs editor, figjam, or other.)

Diagram below:


2. What is the minimum set of test cases needed to make sure that: 
all questions have been asked, 
all combinations have been passed, and 
all answers have been obtained?

Answer: 6 ← incorrect. Correct answer is: 4. 

FEEDBACK from Instructor: 

Hi Daniel, Below is my feedback: 
Test cases: About the test cases for the Jpet store: Overall, good job with the Functional and Non-Functional test cases and the section dividing in the test suite. Good about the test run – put in the failed cases only the bug ID, not the whole link. 

About the bugs for the Jpet store: Also, very good job with the bug reports. Just try to add the screenshots in the bug description as well – whether in the steps or in the actual result. 

Level 2 from LMS: 
Task 2: Correct answer – B. 

Task 3: Correct answer – D. 2 for operator coverage, 1 for decision coverage. We have 1 IF statement and 2 operators -> Open and Close. 

Task 4: Correct answer – 4. 

Level 3 from LMS: Very nice and correct diagram. Suggest to learn how to use Figma.

The minimum amount of test cases is 4 😊
